* Overview

AIM:
1. Recreate a PHYSICAL slipbox, card and scrap paper system to mimic how mind would work (skeumorphism)
2. Memory of physical location (canonical ordering) and physical state of cards (plaintext format only)

Workflow:
1. [X] Open a workspace file (.json) or URL with workspace file in URL
2. [X] Work in workspace
3. [X] Save to workspace file (.json)
4. [ ] Default to overwrite original filename
5. [X] Warn if will exit app before saving

Work in workspace workflow:
1. [X] Create a card on canvas panel by clicking empty space
2. [X] Drag a card around the canvas
3. +Auto-arrange cards in grid (2 x 3 grid)+
4. [X] Mark card (with a single coloured dot - 1 of 10 choices: white, grey, black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)
5. [X] Save workspace view under name
6. [X] Archive card
7. [X] Return card to slipbox

Work on scrap paper workflow: (main thing is to export to cards)
1. [X] Type on scrap paper
2. [X] Archive scrap paper

Work in slipbox workflow:
1. [X] Sort by creation date (canonical)
2. [X] Sort by modified date
3. [X] Sort by colour (ordered by most recent) - black, grey, white, then ROYGBIV
4. [X] Filter by colours
5. [X] Fuzzy search bar
6. [X] Open and delete saved views

Archive workflow:
1. [X] View archive as grid
2. [X] Fuzzy search archive
3. [X] Restore cards (but you can't restore scrap paper)


Use really lightweight syntax. Just use human readable plain text as much as possible.

The first sentence of a card is always bolded automatically as the "title".

If width < certain threshold:
- Put slipbox hidden away in an overlaid side menu you can open and close on the left side
- Auto grid puts cards in a 1-column view instead of two column-view

Width of the cards should be scaled as a percentage of the canvas view width.
