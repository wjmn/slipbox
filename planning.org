* Overview

AIM:
1. Recreate a PHYSICAL slipbox, card and scrap paper system to mimic how mind would work (skeumorphism)
2. Memory of physical location (canonical ordering) and physical state of cards (plaintext format only)

Workflow:
1. Open a workspace file (.json)
2. Work in workspace
3. Save to workspace file (.json) - default to overwrite original filename

Work in workspace workflow:
1. Create a card on canvas panel by clicking empty space
2. Drag a card around the canvas
3. Auto-arrange cards in grid (2 x 3 grid)
4. Mark card (with a single coloured dot - 1 of 10 choices: white, grey, black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)
5. Save workspace view under name
6. Archive card
7. Return card to slipbox

Work on scrap paper workflow: (main thing is to export to cards)
1. Type on scrap paper
2. Archive scrap paper

Work in slipbox workflow:
1. Sort by creation date (canonical)
2. Sort by modified date
3. Sort by colour (ordered by most recent) - black, grey, white, then ROYGBIV
4. Filter by colours
5. Fuzzy search bar
6. Open saved view
7. Delete saved view

Archive workflow:
1. View archive as grid
2. Fuzzy search archive
3. Restore cards (but you can't restore scrap paper)
