* Overview

AIM:
1. Recreate a PHYSICAL slipbox, card and scrap paper system to mimic how mind would work (skeumorphism)
2. Memory of physical location (canonical ordering) and physical state of cards (plaintext format only)

Workflow:
1. Open a workspace file (.json) or URL with workspace file in URL
2. Work in workspace
3. Save to workspace file (.json) - default to overwrite original filename
4. Warn if will exit app before saving

Work in workspace workflow:
1. Create a card on canvas panel by clicking empty space
2. Drag a card around the canvas
3. Auto-arrange cards in grid (2 x 3 grid)
4. Mark card (with a single coloured dot - 1 of 10 choices: white, grey, black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)
5. Save workspace view under name
6. Archive card
7. Return card to slipbox

Work on scrap paper workflow: (main thing is to export to cards)
1. Type on scrap paper
2. Archive scrap paper

Work in slipbox workflow:
1. Sort by creation date (canonical)
2. Sort by modified date
3. Sort by colour (ordered by most recent) - black, grey, white, then ROYGBIV
4. Filter by colours
5. Fuzzy search bar
6. Open, rearrange and delete saved views

Archive workflow:
1. View archive as grid
2. Fuzzy search archive
3. Restore cards (but you can't restore scrap paper)


Use really lightweight syntax. Just use human readable plain text as much as possible.

The first sentence of a card is always bolded automatically as the "title".

If width < certain threshold:
- Put slipbox hidden away in an overlaid side menu you can open and close on the left side
- Auto grid puts cards in a 1-column view instead of two column-view

Width of the cards should be scaled as a percentage of the canvas view width.
